`Face_recognition_with_VGG_Face.ipynb` contains code for loading the weights of trained models into VGG face and training the feature embedding layer (last layer) of the network using Pinterest images. The model was trained using triplet images generated in the code that was inputted into the triplet loss function.

`VGG_face_results.ipynb` contains the code for computing the accuracy of the VGGFace model, and the demo visualization code.
